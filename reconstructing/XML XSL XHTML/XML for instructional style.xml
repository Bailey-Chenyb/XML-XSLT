        <introduction>
            Echinacae, more commonly known as coneflower, are care-free heavy bloomers that bloom from summer to fall. 
            It is an easy flower to grow from seed, and it is known to be <moisture>drought resistant</moisture> and <persistence>long lasting</persistence>.
            They are <appearance><colors part="bloom"> commonly purple, but also can grow in white and yellow</colors></appearance>
            . Coneflower is a native to the eastern part of the United States.

        <introduction>
            Salvia is a good plant to grow if a gardener is looking for variety, since this plant has more than 700 species. 
            It has both <lifeCycle>annual</lifeCycle> and <lifeCycle>perennial</lifeCycle> varieties.
            Salvia blooms are spiky flowershat grow on bushy plants.
            They can reach 10 to <appearance><maxHeight>60 inches </maxHeight></appearance> in height, but most varieties are below 36 inches.
            Salvia blooms in many colors, including <appearance><colors part="bloom">red, scarlet and blue</colors></appearance>.
            Salvia is also known as sage, and it is the largest genus of plants in the <family>mint</family> family.

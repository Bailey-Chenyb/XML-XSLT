         <p>
            <p>
                           Aster is a flower that looks similar to daisies because of its bright yellow, round center that is surrounded by colorful petals. Aster is a perennial, which means it comes back year after year. It grows in many different colors with 
                            white, blue, pink and purple being the most common. 
                           Aster flowers can reach up to 8 feet
                           tall depending on the variety, and the flowers will attract butterflies to the garden
                       <br></p>

         <h4>Planting Steps:</h4>
         <p>1. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            Begin Aster seeds indoors six weeks before the last frost.
                        <br><br>2. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            Plant two seeds 1/8 deep in a smallpot with a sterile potting mix.
                        <br><br>3. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            Make sure the soil is thoroughly wateredbafter planting the seeds.
                        <br><br>4. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            Cover the pots with a plastic bag to keep the environment  warmand moist, which will encourage germination.
                        <br><br>5. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            Seeds should sprout within 10 days. Remove the plastic once the seeds sprout.

         <h4>Growing Steps:</h4>
         <p>
            Condition 1:
             general<br>
            Step 1. 
                                Once seedlings have their second set of leaves, thin them so only the strongest one remains in each pot. 
                            <br><br>
            Step 2. 
                                Once seedlings are 6 inches tall, transplant them outdoors. 
                            <br><br>
            Step 3. 
                                Space them 18 inches apart. Aster grows best in full sun or partial shade. 
                            <br><br>
            Condition 2:
             containers-grown<br>
            Step 1. 
                                In addition to growing well in a flower bed, Aster also grows well in containers as a potted plant. Instead of transplanting seedlings to a flower bed,
                                they can also be transplanted to a 12-inch diameter pot outside.
                            <br><br>
            Step 2. 
                                After transplanting, add mulch around the plants to keep the soil cool and retain moisture.
                            <br><br>
            Condition 3:
             general<br>
            Step 1. 
                                Aster flowers require 1 inch of water per week. 
                            <br><br>
            Condition 4:
             deadheading<br>
            Step 1. 
                                They grow better when trimmed lightly and when their dead flowers are deadheaded. Deadheading is done
            by pinching off the dead blooms.
                            <br><br>
            Condition 5:
             taller variaty<br>
            Step 1. 
                                Also, with taller varieties of the plant, cut back any stems that begin to grow leggy. 
                            <br><br>
            Step 2. 
                                Every three years, divide the Aster plants to maintain the flower quality and growth.
                            <br><br></p>

      <div>
         <h4>Harvest Steps:</h4>
         <p>1. 
                            To harvest, cut the stem low to the ground and check for insects that may be hiding in the stem, flowers or
            leaves. 
                        <br><br>2. 
                            Bring the cuttings indoors and place in water immediately.

                           Cosmos are often seen in wildflower mixes, and they have bright colors that make good borders or as cut flowers. Cosmos have many different varieties which reach different heights and have an assortment of colors.
                           Cosmos can appear in single or double blooms and are easy to care for. The flowers can reach up to 4 feet high but other varieties only reach 1 foot high. 
                           Cosmos are a member of the aster family and have daisy-likeflowers. The flowers will attract butterflies to the garden.

            Condition: general<br>
                            Cosmos grow best in soil that has not been amended, so do not amend the soil prior to planting.
                        <br><br>2. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            The flowers are usually grown from seed, and they are typically directly sown into the outdoor garden.
                        <br><br>3. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            Scatter the seeds around the planting area and cover lightly with soil, no more than 1&#8260;4 inch.
                        <br><br>4. 
            Condition: mix varieties<br>
                            When deciding where to plant Cosmos, be sure to plant taller varieties in the back of the garden bed so they
            don&#8217;t shade other Cosmos or flowers growing there. 
                            Dwarf varieties should be planted as a border along garden beds. It will take up to seven weeks for Cosmos
            to bloom if planted from seed. 
                        <br><br>5. 
            Condition: early start<br>
                            To start early, plant the seeds indoors six weeks before the last frost with a seed-starting mix.

         <h4>Growing Steps:</h4>
         <p>
            Condition 1:
             indoor<br>
            Step 1. 
                                If beginning indoors, transplant Cosmos outside once they are approximately 4 inches tall. 
                            <br><br>
            Condition 2:
             general<br>
            Step 1. 
                                Cosmos&#8217; best growing conditions are hot and dry. 
                            <br><br>
            Step 2. 
                                To care for the Cosmos, be sure to deadhead spent blooms. This encourages more blooms to occur lower on
            the plant, which will make a stronger plant.
                            <br><br>
            Condition 3:
             taller variaty<br>
            Step 1. 
                                Also, if you are growing a taller variety of Cosmos, you may need to stake the plant so it isn&#8217;t damaged by wind or grow the flowers against a fence. 
                                Another option is to plant the flowers closer than 2 feet to one another, where they will protect each
            other from the wind instead of staking. 
                            <br><br>
            Condition 5:
             general<br>
            Step 1. 
                                Cosmos grow nicer, larger flowers if they are watered regularly. Although Cosmos come in both annual and perennial varieties, the plant reseeds itself. 
                            <br><br>
            Condition 5:
             mix<br>
            Step 1. 
                                Cosmos do well when paired with cleome, dahlias and cannas.

      </div>
      <div>
         <h4>Harvest Steps:</h4>
         <p>1. 
                            If hoping to harvest seeds or that the Cosmos will self-sow, leave a few flowers on the plant so they can
            turn into seed pods and reseed themselves.
                        <br><br></p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h4>Restriction</h4>
         <p>1. 
                            do not add fertilizer to the plants
                        <br><br>2. 
                            If Cosmos are planted in an area with amended soil, the flowers grown there will be weak and will not stand
            upright.

            <p>
                           Echinacae, more commonly known as coneflower, are care-free heavy bloomers that bloom from summer to fall. 
                           It is an easy flower to grow from seed, and it is known to be drought resistant and long lasting.
                           They are  commonly purple, but also can grow in white and yellow
                           . Coneflower is a native to the eastern part of the United States.

            Condition: general<br>
                            Although coneflower plants are easy to care for, the seeds are tough to germinate. 
                            To plant coneflower from seed, take the seeds and sprinkle them on  
                            a damp paper towel
                            that has been folded in half.

            Condition: general<br>
                            Fold the paper towel in half again to cover the seeds between the two damp halves. 
                        <br><br>3. 
            Condition: general<br> 
                            Then, place the paper towel in a plastic bag, seal it and keep it in a refrigerator for eight to 12 weeks. 
                            This treatment copies winter conditions, which will allow the seeds to break dormancy to then germinate.
                        <br><br>4. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            After the cold treatment, sow two coneflower seeds in 8-inch pots and cover with a small sprinkling of soil.

            Step 1. 
                                Once coneflowers produce their second set of true leaves, transplant them outside into an area that receives
            full sun. Wait until after the last frost to do this. 
                            <br><br>

            Step 1. 
                                During seasons where rainfall is normal, coneflowers do not require any additional watering. 
                            <br><br>
            Condition 3:
             dry seasons<br>
            Step 1. 
                                The coneflowers thrive in poor soil and are drought resistant, often thriving in dry seasons.

            Step 1. 
                                Once the flowers die at the end of the season, cut the plant back by a third. This will encourage rejuvenation
            in the plant, and it may bloom a second time prior to the cold seasons.

            Condition: general<br>
                            To plant the seeds, loosen the soil and plant seeds 1/8 inch deep. The seeds can be planted even when a light

            Step 1. 
                                Once established, Daisies require little care. Daisies grow well in clumps, and make sure they receive
            at least 1 inch of water per week.

            Step 1. 
                                Since Daisies can grow very tall, sometimes staking is necessary to prevent wind damage. 
                                Daisies also can support themselves if planted close together, or they can be planted along a fence row for more protection.

            Step 1. 
                                To keep strong plants, divide the daisies every three to four years.

            Step 2. 
                                To encourage the most growth, deadhead spent blooms.

            Step 3. 
                                Once blooms finally fade, usually in mid-fall, cut the Daisies back to the ground.

            Step 4. 
                                To prevent disease, do not overhead water the Daisies.

            Condition: general<br>
                            Fill a seed-starting tray with soilless potting mix and sprinkle the seeds over the surface.

            Condition: general<br>
                            Cover the seeds with a thin layer of vermiculture, then cover the tray with plastic and place in a warm area, such as the top of a refrigerator.

            Condition: general<br>
                            Marigolds do not require light to germinate. Marigolds seeds will sprout in as little as four days, and once
            seedlings appear, remove the plastic and move to a sunny location.

            Step 1. 
                                Once seedlings have two true sets of leaves, move to their own pot and continue growing indoors until the last frost has passed.
                            <br><br>
            Step 2. 
                                Transplant them outdoors in a sunny location. Since Marigolds are hardy, they grow well in moist or dry conditions.
                            <br><br>
            Step 3. 
                                Encourage more growth by deadheading the spent blooms.

                            <br><br>
            Condition 3:

         <h4>Harvest Steps:</h4>
         <p>1. 
                            harvest in the early morning when the blooms are just beginning to open.
                        <br><br>2. 
                            Set the freshly cut stems in a vase with warm water. 
                        <br><br>3. 
                            After two hours, strip the lower leaves that are submerged in water. Marigolds will live a week in the vase
            if they are properly maintained. 
                        <br><br>4. 
                            To do so, cut the stem 1 inch from the ground on a sunny day. 
                        <br><br>5. 
                            Wash the entire stem and flower and only remove the stem immediately prior to serving so the flower has the
            best flavor.
                        <br><br>6. 
                            Once deadheaded, the dead blooms can be kept in a dry, cool place and seeds can be harvested for the following
            year.

            Condition: perennials<br>
                            If growing perennial Marigolds, do not fertilize in the winter months . 
                        <br><br>2. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            Be careful to not overfeed the Marigolds, as too much fertilizer will increase leaf production and decrease
            bloom production.

            <p>
                           Phlox adds an array of color to the garden and has fragrant blooms. It has two varieties --- tall and creeping. The tall-growing variety is often used
               in the back of the garden so it doesn&#8217;t shade other plants, whereas the creeping variety can be used as a groundcover. Phlox
               blooms in a star-shaped flower.

                                Seedlings are ready to transplant after the last frost date in the area.
                            <br><br>

            Step 1. 
                                Although tall-growing Phlox should be grown in the back of a garden to not shade sun-loving plants, creeping
            Phlox does well in rocky soils or tough growing conditions.

            Step 2. 
                                Also, cut the plants back before winter so new growth returns in the spring.

            Step 1. 
                                Phlox returns year after year because it is a perennial, but division is necessary every few years to produce the healthiest plant. To divide Phlox, dig up the root ball and divide
            it in half.
                            <br><br>
            Step 2.

                           They are assumed to come in colors of red, but they also come in colors of white, pink and orange .
                           Poppies come in both single and double blooms. Oftentimes, the red Poppy is used to symbolize  fallen warriors
               and it commemorates  Veteran&#8217;s Day.

             general<br>
            Step 1. 
                                When the Poppies sprout, thin them to 6 inches apart.
                            <br><br>
            Step 2. 
                                Once Poppies are established, they do not require frequent watering. Overwatering will result in leggy and tall Poppies. 
                            <br><br>
            Step 3. 
                                They do require deadheading and removing the spent blooms can encourage more blooms to grow. 
                            <br><br>
            Condition 2:
             limited spread<br>
            Step 1. 
                                Poppies self-sow, and if you don&#8217;t want them to spread and sprout in surprising places, pull the plants
            from the ground once they have finished blooming.

         <p>1. 
                            Seedpods will form after the blooms die. Once the seeds can be shaken inside the pod, the pod is ready to

                        <br><br>2. 
                            Cut the pods open and spread the seeds out in a single layer and let dry for a week. 
                        <br><br>3. 
                            Once completely dry, store in an airtight container  until ready to use for baking.

            <p>
                           Rudbeckias are a very popular flower in most gardens. They vary in color from green, yellow, orange, brown and red petals.
                           Rudbeckia also are known as Black-eyed Susans. 
                           They are heat and drought tolerant and are generally low-maintenance plants.
                           They also attract bees and butterflies to the garden. 
                           Rudbeckia grow in annual and perennial varieties, but the annual varieties may self sow.

         <p>1. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            Begin Rudbeckia seeds six to eight weeks before the last frost or direct sow them into the garden two weeks
            before the last frost.
                        <br><br>2. 
            Condition: indoors<br>
                            When starting seeds indoors, sow seeds 1/8-inch-deep in a seed-starting formula and provide bright light after planting. Seeds should germinate in 21 days or less. 
                        <br><br>3. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            Once seedlings emerge, move them to a sunny windowsill or under fluorescent lights, but do not provide light for 24 hours at a time, as seedlings require a dark period as well.

            Condition 1:
             general<br>
            Step 1. 
                                Prior to transplanting outdoors, Rudbeckia need to be hardened off. Hardening off means accustoming the
            plants to outdoor living. To do so, move the seedlings to a sheltered outdoor place protected from the wind and sun for a week. 
                            <br><br>
            Step 2. 
                                After hardening the Rudbeckia off, space the seedlings 12 inches apart in an area with full sun but be sure to transplant on an overcast day.
                            <br><br>
            Step 3. 
                                Although Rudbeckia is drought tolerant, it does require water, especially in hot weather. 
                            <br><br>
            Step 4. 
                                To encourage more growth, deadhead spent blooms regularly. 
                            <br><br>
            Step 5. 
                                To grow the best flowers, be sure to weed regularly and deter weeds by spreading mulch around the base of the plant. Mulch also will help retain moisture.
                            <br><br>
            Step 6. 
                                When plants become crowded, divide them, as blooms will diminish if overcrowded. Divide the plants every
            three to four years.

            <p>
                           Salvia is a good plant to grow if a gardener is looking for variety, since this plant has more than 700 species.
               
                           It has both annual and perennial varieties.
                           Salvia blooms are spiky flowershat grow on bushy plants.
                           They can reach 10 to 60 inches  in height, but most varieties are below 36 inches.
                           Salvia blooms in many colors, including red, scarlet and blue.
                           Salvia is also known as sage, and it is the largest genus of plants in the mint family.

                            Salvia are most commonly grown from seed. They are typically directly sown into the garden, but they can be sown indoors early for a head start on growing.

            Condition: earlier bloom<br>
                            Sowing indoors also encourages the Salvia to bloom earlier than if directly planted outside. To start indoors, sow seeds six to eight weeks
            before the last frost.

                                Transplant Salvia seedlings to the garden after the last frost date and space them 10 to 20 inches apart depending on the variety and its size. Salvia should be spaced apart so they have plenty of room to bloom and grow.
                            <br><br>
            Step 2. 
                                Salvia grows best in full sun, and it grows well in average to good soil.
                            <br><br>
            Step 3.

         <h4>Planting Steps:</h4>
         <p>1. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            Zinnias are a warm-weather flower, but they don&#8217;t like to be transplanted.
                        <br><br>2. 
            Condition: warm<br>
                            plant them directly outdoors when air and soil are 70 degrees or warmer. 
                        <br><br>3. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            Plant seeds 1&#8260;4 inch deep and space them depending on how you want them to grow in the garden.
                        <br><br>4. 
            Condition: general<br>
                            Once they sprout, thin the Zinnias, leaving the strongest seedlings. 
                        <br><br>5. 
            Condition: earlier growth<br>
                            However, if you want the Zinnias to grow earlier, they can be started indoors in peat pots. 
                        <br><br>6. 
            Condition: temperature change<br>
                            Begin them indoors a month before the last frost and once temperatures are warm enough, plant the entire pot
            in the garden.

         <h4>Growing Steps:</h4>
         <p>
            Condition 1:
             general<br>
            Step 1. 
                                Zinnias grow well in full sun, and they are generally resistant to pests.
                            <br><br>
            Step 2. 
                                Water the Zinnias an inch a week, but make sure you don&#8217;t overwater because Zinnias are susceptible to mildew. 
                                When watering, water at the base of the plant and don&#8217;t get water on the leaves or stems.
                                Water early in the morning so the plant has time to dry throughout the heat of the day before night falls.
                            <br><br>
            Condition 2:
             bushier Zinnia<br>
            Step 1. 
                                To produce bushier Zinnia plants, pinch off the top of the plants when they are young. 
                            <br><br>
            Step 2. 
                                Tall Zinnias will need to be staked so they don&#8217;t droop to the ground. 
                            <br><br>
            Condition 3:
             general<br>
            Step 1. 
                                Mulch around the base of the Zinnias to retain moisture and deter weeds.
                            <br><br></p>

         <h4>Harvest Steps:</h4>
         <p>1. 
                            To use in a bouquet, cut the Zinnias above the leaves and place in a vase. More Zinnias will bloom on the
            stem.
